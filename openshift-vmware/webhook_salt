### to test the webhook of the salt-master create a local repo in the openshift plateform 
docker pull gitlab/gitlab-ee
oc new-app gitlab/gitlab-ee
### change expose the service of pod/gitlab and change the port service from 22->80 to access to the dashbord of gitlab
oc expose svc gitlab-ee
### Access to gitlab using the route
### change password admin area 
### create a user from the dashbord of gitlab 
### allow the outbound requests in the gitlab admin area (root/<PASSWORD>)
### login by the user, create new repository and import the salt-master from the vbustash
### Now we deploy the salt<F4>master from the local repo 
oc new-app https://gitlab-ee.cloudpps.lab.example.com/salt.git
### the next step is the create the webhook in the local repo in Settings -> Integrations
### the url of the generic webhook you will find in buildconfig of the salt-master
oc describe bc/salt-master
### finally you have to change the variable <secret> in the url by the value 
oc edit bc/salt-master
### test the webhook by modiying the dockerfile ! Done.
