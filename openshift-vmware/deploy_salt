######## two way to deploy the salt-master 
### the first is to clone the repo and run the dockerfile on local after we create a pod using the images created following this steps
git clone https://vbustash.vistaprint.net/scm/vm/salt-master.git
cd salt-master
docker build .
### then execute the script to create the pods with specifying the image builded and taged 
oc apply -f salt_master_pod

### the second one is to create the pods directly from the repo by running this command and specifying the secrets
oc new-app https://vbustash.vistaprint.net/scm/vm/salt-master.git --env-file=secrets.env
